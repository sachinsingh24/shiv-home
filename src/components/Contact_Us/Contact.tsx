        <h2>About JPU</h2>
        <p>
          It has been 37 years since our journey began in 1986, when we ventured
          into the real estate sector, initially with humble beginnings as
          labourers, then as contractors and eventually working our way up to
          launch our own real estate projects. Since then, we had completed over
          90 projects in the MMR Region and have an overall experience of 5
          million square feet of development along the central suburbs of Thane,
          Dombivli, Kalyan, Ambarnath and in the Navi Mumbai nodes of Kharghar,
          Kamothe, Karanjade and Panvel.. Our team comprises of a combination of
          experienced professionals with grassroots experience in all the
          segments of real estate including design, planning, finance and
          infrastructure construction. We have witnessed the initial expansion
          of Mumbai and the MMR region and are also witness to the changing
          trends and expectations of the new age young and dynamic professionals
          representing the taste and aspirations of the newer generations. The
          reference of existing customers has become the leading sales pitch for
          the group and which the group has proudly embraced as the hallmark of
          identity as a successful developer.
